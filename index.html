    <br>
    <br>
    Marty started training at Frank Rimer's Dropkixx training school which would also produce wrestlers like Darren
    Burridge, Martin Stone, The Kartel and Paul Robinson.
    <br>
    <br>
    Scurll made his debut for Dropkixx at the Fondu Club in Purfleet, defeating Jimmy Starr by two falls to one. Once
    under the tutorship of Jon Ritchie, who by this time was in charge at Dropkixx, Marty took part in Dropkixx's Shoot
    Fighting Tournament (the brainchild of Jon Ritchie himself). With two categories in place - middleweight and
    heavyweight - Scurll would go on to win the middleweight tournament, in the process becoming Dropkixx's first
    middleweight champion (the heavyweight tournament was won by future WWE wrestler Wade Barrett).
    <br>
    <br>
    Scurll also
    competed regularly for Summit Promotions, and at the end of the year formed a tag team with Paul Robinson as 'The
    Party Boys' (or 'The Midnight Ravers', as they were sometimes billed).
    <br>
    Scurll would go on to appear for Premier Promotions and this would be the place where he would meet Phil Powers,
    who he ended up wrestling many times in the summer season on the holiday camps circuit.
    <br>
    <br>
    On 16 July, Marty wrestled
    his idol Steve Grey losing two Falls to one for Summit Promotions in Rayleigh, Essex.
    Scurll was one of the eight men entered into British Wrestling United's National Under 23's Championship
    tournament. Scurll met Stiro in the first round but the match went to a non-contest. Scurll later received a shot
    at the eventual winner Sam Slam in 2007, but was defeated. During the rest of the year, Scurll debuted for the
    likes of IPW:UK and RQW, wrestling Jonny Storm, Taiji Ishimori, Bubblegum and many others.
    <br>
    <br>
    Scurll as the British Cruiserweight Champion in April 2012
    On 5 June 2007, Marty made his debut for All Star Wrestling by defeating Jimmy Starr at Gravesend. Marty competed
    regularly for All Star, including main eventing Fairfield Halls, Croydon against Pro Wrestling NOAH's Shuhei
    Taniguchi and Tsutomu Hirayanagi. In IPW:UK, Marty would reform his tag team with Zack Sabre, Jr., but under the
    name 'The Leaders of the New School'. Since, they have feuded with BritRage (Mark Sloan and Wade Flitzgerald) and
    the Kartel. Other wrestlers Scurll has found himself up against have been Johnny Kidd, Robbie Dynamite, Martin
    Stone, Nick Aldis, Andy Simmonz and Swiss Money Holding. Marty Scurll wrestled and lost to Doug Williams in
    IPW:UK's British National Championship Tournament.
    <br>
    <br>
    In 2009, Scurll and Sabre Jr focused their attention on the IPW:UK tag team division, and picked up a memorable win
    against tag team champions The Thrillers (Mark Haskins and Joel Redman) during the company's February tour. A
    highly anticipated rematch finally took place between the teams at the 2009 "Sittingbourne Spectacular" after the
    Leaders' scheduled opponents had to pull out through injury. This time the championships were on the line, and the
    Leaders won again to claim their first championship gold in IPW:UK. The match was considered a Match of the Year
    candidate, and the feud between the Leaders and the Thrillers became the dominant storyline in IPW:UK through the
    summer, culminating in the Leaders winning a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match against their rivals in September.
    The Leaders have enjoyed an unbroken reign as champions since that time.
    <br>
    <br>
    Scurll and Sabre Jr competed in the first match of the newly re-launched Frontier Wrestling Alliance in August
    2009, beating Northern Xposure (NX) at "New Frontiers". The feud between these two teams would continue for the
    next several months, with NX eventually sealing a 2-1 victory in a best of three series after defeating Sabre Jr
    and Scurll at "British Uproar" in February 2010. Since then, the Leaders of the New School have entered into the
    promotion's tag team championship tournament, qualifying for the semi finals after defeating Project Ego at "The
    Art of War".
    <br>
    <br>
    On 28 April 2012, Scurll defeated Sami Callihan in the final of an eight-man tournament to determine the new
    British Cruiserweight Champion.
    <br>
    <br>
    On 15 March 2014, Scurll defeated Colt Cabana in a 30 Minute Iron Fist match to become Revolution Pro Wrestling
    Undisputed British Heavyweight Champion. Scurll would go on to successfully defend the championship against the
    likes of Ricochet, Kevin Steen, Martin Stone, Davey Richards, Doug Williams, Shelton Benjamin, Rocky Romero and
    others, before losing the title to New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) import AJ Styles at the 2015 Summer Sizzler event
    on 14 June 2015.
    <br>
    <br>
    Scurll debuted for Scotland's Insane Championship Wrestling promotion in late 2014, unsuccessfully challenging
    Kenny Williams for the ICW Zero-G Championship before continuing to appear for the promotion in 2015, culminating
    in a main-event non-title loss to reigning ICW World Heavyweight Champion Drew Galloway. Scurll scored his
    first win in ICW in a four-way match against Noam Dar, Jack Gallagher and Dan Moloney.
    <br>
    <br>
    On 4 April 2015, at a sold-out British Championship Wrestling event in Scotland, Scurll challenged Drew Galloway in
    a Double Title match for both the Evolve World Championship and the DGUSA Open the Freedom Gate Championship – but
    was defeated.
    <br>
    <br>
    In October 2015, Scurll debuted for Global Force Wrestling on their "UK Invasion", losing to GFW Global Champion
    Nick Aldis in a singles match and teaming with Rampage Brown in a losing effort against Doug Williams and
    Aldis. Scurll returned to the company in March 2016, unsuccessfully challenging Sonjay Dutt for the GFW NEX*GEN
    Championship.
    <br>
    <br>
    In early October 2017 at WCPW Refuse to Lose, Scurll won a triple threat match between Joe Hendry and Will Ospreay
    and himself to become the 6th and final WCPW champion, before the company rebranded as Defiant Wrestling.
    <br>
    <br>
    On December 4th at Defiant Wrestling's first iPPV, titled WeAreDefiant, Scurll was given the new championship belt
    by General Manager Stu Bennett, and had a confrontation with the debuting Austin Aries at the beginning of the
    show. In the main event of the show, Scurll successfully defended the championship in a triple threat match between
    himself, Joe Hendry and Martin Kirby. However, on December 5th at Defiant's first episode of their new weekly show
    (uploaded December 15th on YouTube), Scurll lost the championship to Austin Aries, ending Scurll's reign at 34
    days.

    Progress Champion. He beat Zack Sabre Jr in an acclaimed semi-final match before competing in a four-way match for
    the title against Mike Mason, El Ligero and winner Nathan Cruz. Scurll went on to challenge Cruz for the title
    in a Two Out of Three Falls match at Chapter Two, failing to capture the title.Competing regularly for

    Twenty-One, Travis’ final match before his retirement from wrestling and death from stomach cancer. Scurll
    turned firmly villainous following this match; gaining a demented mean streak that saw him win the Progress
    Championship for the first time in a No Disqualification match against Will Ospreay at Chapter Twenty-Five.
    <br>
    <br>
    Scurll went on to successfully defend the title against Mark Haskins,[24] Chris Hero, and Tommy End in

    Championship to Mark Haskins in a triple-threat main event match also involving Tommy End at Chapter Thirty-Six,
